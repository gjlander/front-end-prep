# Movie Diary Refactor With Parcel

-   No longer using Tailwind CDN
-   Deployment on Render is part of MVP
-   Cover routing with deployment
-   Highlight npx command to see deployed version locally

## Adding additional entry point in config file

## The focus of this project is to get comfortable using `npm` and third party libraries, and to give you practical experience in refactoring an existing code base. Parcel is a tool to facilitate that, but the focus is not to deep dive into how Parcel works. We will not be using it again in the bootcamp.
