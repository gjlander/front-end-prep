# JS Loops and Arrays

## Loops

-   Used to do the same thing over and over until a condition is met.

### for loop

-   We use it when we know how many times we want it to run
-   we must declare, i used as convention
-   Second is the condition, third is the incrementor

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log("It's party time!");
}
```

-   Why did it print 6 times?
